# dynamic_fields_modeling
Code to model dynamic neural fields [Harper (2021) Ch. 4]

Incorporates ability to modify shape of representational objects to simulate differences in phonetic space occupied by representation

Contains wrappers and modifications of base DNF functionality scripts to simulate:
1) selection of articulatory target for speech production
2) identification of object of perception (both phoneme perceived and its phonetic properties)
3) coarticulatory effects on target selection in speech production
4) imitation of a heard token
